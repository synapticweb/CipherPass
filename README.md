# CipherPass

CipherPass is a (for now) basic password manager for Android built on top of the well known SqlCipher database encryption library. CipherPass is written in Kotlin, using the Android architecture components.

The application has currently the following main features:
- The password data is stored in an SqlCipher database (AES 256bit encryption).
- The authentication can be password based or biometric based.
- The database entries are searchable.
- The displayed entries can be sorted by creation date, modification date or entry name.
- ...more to come, as the application is still in development.
